# cbtopology

This is a temporary package that is used to wrap up all of the Couchbase
Server topology monitoring that we do. Eventually this package will be
removed in favor of sharing the same topology monitoring we use to actually
dispatch operations to the cluster, but for now this is the simpler path to
a working gateway.
